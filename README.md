# Capsule-Net-TF

A tiny implementation of the recently published Capsule Network by G.Hinton and colleague ( [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf) )

 * A novel concept of 'Capsules' which is basically vector-neurons as opposed to scalar neurons (the familier ones)
 * A routing algorithm (refer paper)
 * a not-so-deep network of capsules and normal convolutions
 * state-of-the-art performance

## My implementation is still running on a 1050-TI GPU and hopefully is correct. I will add the results as soon as I can
